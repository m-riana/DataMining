------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on segmenting ABCDEatsâ€™ clients based on data collected from 31,888 customers from three cities. Data was collected over a period of three months. The main goal is to apply Unsupervised Learning, specifically Clustering methods to identify customer segments.
The project is divided into two Jupyter Notebooks. The first one (1_EDA.ipynb) contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and concludes with saving the datasets in CSV file format (data_set_after1st_notebook.ipynb), while the second one (2_FE_Clustering_approach.ipynb) focuses on data pre-processing, feature creation and transforatmion, as well as, clustering.
