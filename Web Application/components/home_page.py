    """
    Considering the ever-increasing competitiveness in the food delivery business, our team was hired by ABCDEats Inc. 
    to analyze their customer-collected data and develop a data-driven marketing strategy. The goal was to analyze customer 
    data, segment clients into meaningful groups using ML clustering algorithms, and provide actionable insights to enhance 
    targeted marketing campaigns and service personalization.

    To achieve this, a dataset of 31,888 clients, collected over three months from three cities, was extensively analyzed. 
    Based on the company's marketing requirements, two distinct segmentation perspectives were defined: 
    **Value and Preference** and **Activity and Engagement**. After applying data preprocessing and feature engineering 
    techniques, clustering algorithms were used to create initial segmentations for each perspective. 
    The K-means algorithm, with three clusters for each perspective, proved to be the most effective. Following the segmentation, a final merged solution was obtained with three final clusters.

    This web application consolidates our findings and provides ABCDEats with a user-friendly interface to explore the 
    segmentation insights. It allows for:
    - **Cluster Profiling**: To analyze customer segments based on their behavior and preferences.
    - **Prediction Module**: To classify new clients into clusters, enabling data-driven onboarding strategies.

    The application allows the company's marketing team to make informed decisions, improve customer satisfaction, 
    and overall business efficiency.
